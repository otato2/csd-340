                    Starting in highschool, I discovered my like and understanding
                    for computer programming as a whole. Starting with the Java
                    language over 8 years ago, I have picked up enough skill to
                    develop some of my own programs for some of my families side
                    Projects.

                    with a Nintendo 64, I have always been an avid gamer. Currently

                    Starting at a young age with my father, I have always been
                    helping out with DIY projects around the house. From helping
                    complete a full kitchen remodel to a gut of an entire bathroom
                    I have seen a few things in the renovation world. Currently
                    working on improving my first house.

                <div class="card-content">
                    Over the last 6 years I have improved my skills and ability to
                    manage 3rd party vendors for service contracts at my profession.
                    Typically I am called to the scene when a vendor is onsite due
                    to my ability to manage and accommodate the different things that
                    may come up during they are at work.

                <div class="card-content">
                    Managing time has been something that I have drastically made
                    strides to improve in my life. This all started at my previous
                    employer when I would be required to balance different projects
                    all while needing to align and prioritize different issues when
                    called upon.
